DOM Window is a jQuery plugin that was originally part of the "jQuery-swip" collection of plugins by Cody Lindley and released under MIT license. You can get the original at http://swip.codylindley.com/

It is designed to do interstitial-style "windows" that appear on top of a webpage. Typically used to display ads or prompt the user for a login before continuing.

This version fixes a bug that prevents the loader graphic from displaying when using an iframe and adds an option waitForIframe which, when set, prevents the overlay from appearing at all until the iframe has fully loaded
